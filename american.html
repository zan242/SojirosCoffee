                    <h2>Brazil Serra Do Cigano</h2>
                    <p>
                        This Coffee has a very funky taste. It's a light roast that is both nutty and fruity. It's sweeter than most American coffees and has a slightly fuller
                        body than most light roasts. All around this coffee is a bit of a wild card, but is excellent none the less.

                    <p>
                        This is one of my favorite coffees. Its very floral and has notes of pineapple and blueberry with caramel undertones that all 
                        combine to make a sweet and tart taste. It has a medium body and fruity aftertaste that will leave you wanting more.

                    <h2>PT's Flatlander Signature Blend</h2>
                    <p>
                        This South American Blend has a nutty, dark choclaty flavor and has a strong bittersweet chocolate aroma.
                        It's a medium roast, but the flavor of the coffee still comes through and mixes well with the flavor of the roast.
