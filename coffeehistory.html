                    <h1>How Coffee Spread</h1>
                    <p>
                        While the actual origin of coffee is debated, the earliest evidence of coffee was found in Yemen 
                        in the 14th century. Its popularity quickly spread through the neighboring Arabia and by the 15th
                        century, coffee houses dotted the countries. So much so that many governments temporarily banned coffee 
                        because of the caffeine in it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Coffee eventually spread to Turkey and through Istanbul made its foray in Europe. The earliest recorded evidence 
                        of coffee in Europe was Venice in the late 16th century. It made its way to England, France, and Germany along
                        with many other European countries in the next century.

                    <p>
                        Coffee reached the Americas during the European colonization efforts. It first came to the Caribbean in the early
                        18th century and quickly started to be grown there. Coffee became popular in North America after the Boston Tea
                        Party, since tea became seen as unpatriotic. In the 19th century, Brazil became the largest coffee producer in the world
                        and it still is today.

                        The first known method for brewing coffee is from turkey and called the Ibrik method. It involved steeping grounds in hot water for up to half a day.
                        This took a little too long and made brewing a lot of coffee in shops difficult. To deal with this, the Biggon pot was invented, which was a more primitive version
                        of the drip coffee we know today. The next major innovation in coffee brewing was the espresso machine, which was invented in Italy in 1884. While this machine
                        was much less complex than the ones used today, it was still a large part of coffee brewing history. The next brewing method, which is still widely used today,
                        is the french press. This uses a metal plunger to separate coffee ground from the actual coffee. All of the brewing methods so far traditionally used cloth or 
                        metal filters, but in the early 20th century, disposable paper filters were invented. Something resembling the modern coffee maker was invented in the 1950s
                        and refined to get what is common today.
