                    <h2>Highwire Batak, Sumatra</h2>
                    <p>
                        This medium roast coffee has the common earthy and chocolaty notes found among asian coffees, but also has a hint of fruit. 
                        The coffee has a very heavy body and is fairly acidic, which is pretty unique for a medium roast from Asia.
                        You can buy it <a href="https://www.highwirecoffee.com/products/batak-sumatra">here.</a>

                    <p>
                        This blend has a very chocolaty flavor and aroma along with a little bit of frutiness and vanilla. It has a full body and
                        is slighty acidic. This blend was developed with a chocolate company and as a result pairs very well with chocolate.
