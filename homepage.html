                    <h1>How is Coffee Produced</h1>
                    <p>
                        Coffee is a drink brewed from roasted and ground coffee beans. Getting these 
                        beans is an arduous process with a lot of steps.     
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First off, the coffee needs to be grown and picked. Coffee is actually the seed of 
                        a coffee cherry that grows on a coffee plant. The plant is harvested either annually 
                        or bi-annually depending on where the coffee is being grown. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After coffee is harvested it has to be proccessed to remove the seed from the fruit.
                        Depending on how the farm chooses to proccess their beans, the pulp and husk is separated
                        from the bean and then sorted into different grades of coffee.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now that the beans have been proccessed, roasters can choose to use the beans as a <strong>single origin</strong>
                        coffee or mix multiple types of beans in a <strong>blend</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Single Origin</strong> - Coffee that is sourced from a single region or producer.
                        <li><strong>Blend</strong> - A mixture of mupltple origin coffee beans.
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The beans are now ready to be roasted. There are many different types of roasts, most commonly 
                        being organized under 3 categories: <strong>Light</strong>, <strong>Medium</strong>, and <strong>Dark</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Light</strong> - Bright, acidic flavors. Retains most of the flavor qualities of the coffee.
                        <li><strong>Medium</strong> - Mix of acidity and full body. The coffee's flavor qualities will be mixed with the flavor of the roasting.
                        <li><strong>Dark</strong> - Full bodied and lacking in acidity. The coffee's flavor is almost completely masked by the flavor of the roasting.
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The last step in the proccess is grounding and brewing. The coarsness of the grind is determined
                        by the type of coffee and chosen brewing method to bring out specific flavors in the coffee. 
                        The different brewing methods produce fairly similar flavors and are up to personal preference.
                    </p>

                <div class="offsetbgblue">
                    <h1>Coffee's Flavor</h1>
                    <p>
                        Coffee catches a lot of flak for being too bitter, but properly roasted and brewed coffee actually has a complex
                        combination of different flavors and aromas that are anything but bitter.       
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       The different flavors and armoas in coffee are often based off of where they were grown and how they were brewed. 
                       Depending on whether the beans were grown in <strong>The Americas</strong>, <strong>Africa</strong>, or <strong>Asia</strong>
                       heavily reflect on the flavor and mouth feel.      
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>American</strong> - American coffee is fairly balanced, having a mix of spicy and nutty qualities.
                        <li><strong>African</strong> - African coffee is the brightest, being acidic and fruity.
                        <li><strong>Asian</strong> - Asian coffee is sweeter, containing notes of earthy and choclaty flavors.
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Some coffee snobs will tell you that the only way to drink your coffee is black, however some coffees can actually benefit from 
                        adding milk or cream. Some coffees, however, taste much worse with milk, which is why knowing your coffee and what it plays well 
                        with can greatly enhance your coffee experience.          
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aside from drinking coffee black or with cream and sugar, there are a wide varietiy of different coffee and espresso drinks that all 
                        taste wildy different. Brewing coffee cold or mixing it with different syrups and milk frothiness allow you to so many different kinds of 
                        drinks that anyone can find something they'd enjoy even if they dont like traditional coffee.
